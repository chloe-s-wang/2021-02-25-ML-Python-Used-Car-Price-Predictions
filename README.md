# 2021-02-25-Used-Car-Price-Predictions
Using data set downloaded from Kaggle where observations were built from used car listings on Craigslist, this project predicts whether a used car price is less than $12,000, and then uses available features to predict this. Decision Tree Classifiers and KNN algorithms were used, and confusion matrices were constructed to evaluate model performance.
