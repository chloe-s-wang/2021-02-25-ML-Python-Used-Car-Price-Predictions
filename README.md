# 2021-02-25-Used-Car-Price-Predictions
Using data set downloaded from Kaggle, this project predicts whether a used car price is less than $12,000, and then uses available features to predict this. Observations in this data are built from used car listings on Craigslist. Decision Tree Classifiers and KNN algorithms were used, and confusion matrices were constructed to evaluate model performance.
